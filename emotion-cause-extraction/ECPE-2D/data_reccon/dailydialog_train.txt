5,null,null,Well . it was all a big mistake . actually . He got home on Friday night really late . and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients . so he was really drunk .
6,null,null,Was he out with the guys from the bank ?
7,null,null,Yes . I think so .
8,null,null,Oh . yeah . they always get really drunk .

11,null,null,No . she left him last year .

15,null,null,Oh yes . well . he tried to climb in through the bathroom window . but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress . so they called the police .
16,null,null,Oh . no .
17,null,null,Yes . So when the cops arrived . they didn't believe his story

14,null,null,Well . my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?
15,null,null,That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
16,null,null,Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?
17,null,null,It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .

7,null,null,Look . we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions . and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But . it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .

6,null,null,What did you do ?
7,fear,fake_evidence,I didn't do anything . Finally . he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
8,null,null,Did he leave when you left ?
9,null,null,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
10,null,null,What did you do ?
11,fear,fake_evidence,He followed me all the way home !
12,null,null,That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .
13,fear,fake_evidence,Yes . he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally . just when I got home . I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
14,null,null,Actually . I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again . then maybe you should call .
15,fear,fake_evidence,Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
16,null,null,Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
17,null,null,I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .
18,null,null,Listen . Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time . and if he follows you again . then I think we should go to the police . But for now . just try not to worry .

7,null,null,Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming . my idol . will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .
8,null,null,It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?
9,null,null,In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .
10,null,null,I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .
11,null,null,Oh . you know something . He is 2 . 26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .
12,null,null,I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .
13,null,null,Yes . what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .
14,null,null,That's really terrible . Oh . God . we forgot to cheer for Daddy .
15,null,null,Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming . right ?
16,null,null,You are always so naughty .

2,null,null,You could get him a tie .
3,surprise,fake_evidence,Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .
4,null,null,Why not ?
5,null,null,Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .
6,null,null,Well . you can buy him a pet iguana then .
7,happiness,fake_evidence,That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
8,null,null,He would think you were crazy . Caroline .
9,null,null,Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift . and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .
10,null,null,How much do you want to spend ?
11,null,null,Well . he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .
12,null,null,Alright . I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .
13,null,null,Yes .
14,null,null,Well . he isn't a lawyer . so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
15,null,null,What should he have then ?
16,null,null,I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know . not so hard and square like a briefcase .
17,happiness,fake_evidence,I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?
18,null,null,I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .
19,null,null,Alright . We can go later then .
20,null,null,We can buy something for Mom and Dad here . and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .
21,happiness,fake_evidence,Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
22,null,null,She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .
23,null,null,Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?
24,null,null,How about the iguana ?
25,null,null,I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .
26,null,null,A tie ?
27,anger,fake_evidence,Oh . shut up about ties ! Forget about ties . why not ?

2,null,null,What ? What did you buy ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,null,null,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,null,null,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes . Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,null,null,And ?
7,null,null,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,null,null,And it's a brick ?
9,null,null,Yes .
10,surprise,fake_evidence,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,null,null,I wanted to . But he said . no . the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened . other people won't believe it's new .
12,null,null,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,null,null,Yes . it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look . it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,surprise,fake_evidence,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,null,null,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,null,null,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So . what I think is . you deserve to get cheated !
17,null,null,C'mon . don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,null,null,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19,null,null,You're right . Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

1,null,null,Hi . Becky . what's up ?
2,null,null,Not much . except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
3,null,null,What's the problem ?
4,null,null,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .
5,null,null,For example ?
6,null,null,Well . last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food . but if you listened to her . then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
7,null,null,No . I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
8,null,null,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
9,null,null,My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough . then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them . the schools we sent them too . and everything else under the sun .
10,null,null,You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?
11,null,null,We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing . and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood . and now everything is a lot more peaceful .
12,happiness,fake_evidence,That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .

2,surprise,fake_evidence,What ? What did you buy ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,null,null,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,anger,fake_evidence,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes . Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,null,null,And ?
7,null,null,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,null,null,And it's a brick ?
9,null,null,Yes .
10,surprise,fake_evidence,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,null,null,I wanted to . But he said . no . the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened . other people won't believe it's new .
12,null,null,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,null,null,Yes . it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look . it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,null,null,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,null,null,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,null,null,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So . what I think is . you deserve to get cheated !
17,null,null,C'mon . don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,null,null,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .

3,happiness,fake_evidence,Well . let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .
4,happiness,fake_evidence,Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .
5,happiness,fake_evidence,Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7.10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl . it is going to be impossible .

1,null,null,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
2,surprise,fake_evidence,What ? Why do we have to do that ?
3,null,null,Well . at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case . to take better advantage of the daylight available . we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
4,anger,fake_evidence,I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this . such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
5,null,null,That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California . we are in Pacific Standard Time . that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well . then we were in China Standard Time . and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
6,surprised,fake_evidence,That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference . even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours . we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !

9,null,null,Ah ...
10,null,null,And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ' ll get the Youth Group to serve us .

Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh . your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !

1,happiness,fake_evidence,Guess what came in the mail today ?
2,null,null,What ?
3,happiness,fake_evidence,My acceptance letter to Yale !
4,happiness,fake_evidence,Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?
5,happiness,fake_evidence,Freshman orientation is the last week of august . but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .
6,happiness,fake_evidence,You ' re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?
7,null,null,Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa . buy a plane ticket . and pack my things . But first . I want to register for classes .
8,null,null,When can you do that ?
9,null,null,Well . they sent me their prospectus . so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?
10,null,null,Sure . What can you choose from ?
11,null,null,Well . I have to take all the fundamental course . plus a few from my major .
12,null,null,What is your major ?
13,null,null,I hope to major in English literature . but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year . so we ' ll see .
14,null,null,What are the fundamental course ?
15,null,null,In order to graduate . every student must take a certain amount of classes in history . math . English . philosophy . science and art .
16,null,null,Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .
17,null,null,Yes . it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .
18,surprise,fake_evidence,Really ?
19,null,null,oh . sure . In British . students don ' t have to take the foundation course .
20,null,null,why not ?
21,happiness,fake_evidence,maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .

1,anger,fake_evidence,I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
2,null,null,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan . get some investors and start working for myself !
4,null,null,Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
5,anger,fake_evidence,Well . no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean . all you have to do is explain your business . how you are going to do things and that ' s it . right ?
6,null,null,You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has . history . etc .
7,null,null,Well . that seems easy enough .
8,null,null,Wait . there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part . a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage . where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
9,null,null,Geez . Is that all ?
10,null,null,Almost . the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales . cash flow and profits . After all . people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
11,happiness,fake_evidence,Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

14,null,null,Anyways . are you going to the party tonight ?
15,null,null,Yes . I am . Say . are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?
16,null,null,I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .
17,null,null,Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .
18,null,null,I guess that you will really be dressing down .

10,null,null,No . by that time . I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries . cathedrals . fountains . statues . and palaces !
11,null,null,So what did you do ?
12,happiness,fake_evidence,We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees . watched a movie . and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
13,happiness,fake_evidence,My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?
14,happiness,fake_evidence,Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .

1,null,null,I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !
2,null,null,Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .
3,null,null,It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser . one small mistake can cost the company millions .
4,null,null,But it wasn ' t just you who was involved . right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .
5,null,null,That ' s true . but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault . and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .
6,null,null,Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?
7,null,null,I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .
8,null,null,Well . you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?
9,null,null,Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,Well . that ' s good . If you lose your job . you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .
11,happiness,fake_evidence,That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
12,happiness,fake_evidence,If you lose your job . you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally . you ' ll save plenty of money .
13,happiness,fake_evidence,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !

2,happiness,fake_evidence,Yeah . I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !
3,happiness,fake_evidence,We've never sold this much before . our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market . up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !
4,happiness,fake_evidence,not only our annual sales brake a record . but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump . we finally back in the black .
5,null,null,The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .
6,null,null,I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution . and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign . we have become the top sellers in the field .
7,happiness,fake_evidence,Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .

2,null,null,What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?
3,disgust,fake_evidence,He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out . referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
4,null,null,Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...
5,disgust,fake_evidence,You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude . as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed . not just his words .
6,null,null,That ' s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ' ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ' t be able to change him .

6,happiness,fake_evidence,He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman . with the white chiffon !
7,happiness,fake_evidence,She's chic . isn't she ?
8,happiness,fake_evidence,Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look . the hem has lowered . and the waist narrowed .
9,happiness,fake_evidence,It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing . I would say .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .
11,disgust,fake_evidence,Most women follow fashion like sheep . They don't know any better than imitate .
12,disgust,fake_evidence,I quite agree with you . See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !
13,happiness,fake_evidence,The gown is quite expensive . believe me .
14,disgust,fake_evidence,So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .
16,happiness,fake_evidence,You're quite slim . In fact . if you were one of those starlets . the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .

6,null,null,I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss . I didn't even have enough to eat !
7,null,null,I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
8,null,null,our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .
9,disgust,fake_evidence,I see . Well . then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .

4,happiness,fake_evidence,That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
5,happiness,fake_evidence,I'm not really in the mood for Italian . actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .
6,happiness,fake_evidence,If you want spicy food . then I'd recommend going to a Thai . Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?
7,happiness,fake_evidence,I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But . they've westernized their food . so it's not actually that spicy .
8,happiness,fake_evidence,You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .
9,happiness,fake_evidence,The Taj ? They're a bit expensive . but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,The Taj it is then .
11,happiness,fake_evidence,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
12,happiness,fake_evidence,They'll still charge us a corkage fee .
13,happiness,fake_evidence,That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
14,happiness,fake_evidence,Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .

3,null,null,What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?
4,null,null,It ' s a prediction of your month . based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th . so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ?
5,null,null,January 5th .
6,happiness,fake_evidence,Let ' s see . . . you ' re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work . but you could see new . exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ' ll both have interesting summers !
7,null,null,That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work . and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
8,null,null,No . it ' s not . your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
9,null,null,Well . you certainly match those criteria . but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?
10,happiness,fake_evidence,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !

5,null,null,Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold . and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
6,null,null,You need a babysitter .
7,null,null,Yes . I'd ask Jill . the girl I've had before . but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
8,null,null,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
9,null,null,I don't want to do that to you . Karen .
10,null,null,Why not ?
11,null,null,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
12,null,null,I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know . Sara Ralston . She is 17 . and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church . and I trust her completely .
13,null,null,I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice . I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
14,null,null,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
16,null,null,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
17,happiness,fake_evidence,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

2,null,null,It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,It ' s simply because the tins were damaged .
4,null,null,It appears to be the only case to us . that the goods have been damaged on the way .
5,anger,fake_evidence,I am sorry to say it's not on the way . but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .
6,null,null,Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ?

7,anger,fake_evidence,They both just talk about how great they are all the time .
8,anger,fake_evidence,They soud like the neighbours from hell !

14,null,null,Maybe you should think about moving .
15,disgust,fake_evidence,I can't afford to move right now .
16,null,null,Well . perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them . they'll turn out to be more sensitive .
17,disgust,fake_evidence,I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them . you'd understand .

4,null,null,Have you found anything yet ?
5,null,null,You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?
6,null,null,You should be able to find something comfortable in town . though that would be kind of far from school .

1,null,null,I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .
2,happiness,fake_evidence,Alright . sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .
3,null,null,What does it come with standard ?
4,null,null,On all our new cars . the standards includeair conditioning . anti-lock brakes . air bags . and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord . there is another standard item as well . The Accord com
5,null,null,Cruise control ? I don't like that .
6,surprise,fake_evidence,Why not . sir ?
7,null,null,I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?
8,null,null,Well . sir . I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .
9,null,null,I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .
10,null,null,You know . sir . you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it . you just never turn it on .
11,null,null,I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?
12,null,null,No . the sunroof is optional . sir .
13,null,null,I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .
14,null,null,Well . I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now . we will have it for you in August .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,That's good enough . I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?
16,null,null,We have this new model in red . white . black . or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .
17,null,null,My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
18,null,null,I know the color you mean . Is this it . sir ?
19,null,null,Yes . I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?
20,null,null,Yes . you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .
21,happiness,fake_evidence,Well . I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .
22,happiness,fake_evidence,You have made a good choice . sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines . very reliable .
23,null,null,Yes . I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .
24,null,null,Alright . sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .

8,disgust,fake_evidence,I think the government fined him a small amount . and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ' s still a millionaire .
9,disgust,fake_evidence,That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .

9,happiness,fake_evidence,It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November .

The bright red . pink . scarlet . and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout . with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,Sounds marvelous .
11,happiness,fake_evidence,You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .

1,happiness,fake_evidence,I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !
2,null,null,I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
3,null,null,Well . it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch . But really . I think it's worth it .
4,null,null,I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food . you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .
5,null,null,How do you mean " suffer " ?
6,null,null,I mean . in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food . So we miss the food in Taiwan too much . Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .
7,null,null,Even in the winter ?
8,null,null,Yes . even in the winter .
9,null,null,And even if it takes two hours . huh ?
10,happiness,fake_evidence,Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !
11,null,null,Well . this really is delicious . I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .
12,happiness,fake_evidence,Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !
13,null,null,I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum . " right ?
14,null,null,Yes . all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .
15,null,null,So when you Chinese think of Chinatown . you mostly think of food . Is that right ?
16,happiness,fake_evidence,Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .
17,null,null,And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner . after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .
18,null,null,No way !
19,null,null,What do you mean ?
20,null,null,We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .
21,null,null,Alright . alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?
22,null,null,No . dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time . or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown .
23,null,null,Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?
24,null,null,No . dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .
25,happiness,fake_evidence,I wonder if you can cook things this good .
26,happiness,fake_evidence,I'm a great cook actually . You will see .

9,null,null,How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?

21,happiness,fake_evidence,That sounds alright .

4,happiness,fake_evidence,A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ' d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ' s supposed to help with your complexion .
5,happiness,fake_evidence,Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures .
6,happiness,fake_evidence,This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !
7,happiness,fake_evidence,I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?
8,null,null,Oh . I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .
9,null,null,Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
10,null,null,What ' s special about a thai massage ?
11,null,null,That ' s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet .

8,null,null,Yeah . She died in her sleep .
9,null,null,I'm sorry she's gone .
10,null,null,At least she didn't suffer .
11,null,null,I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .

2,surprise,fake_evidence,Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?
3,happiness,fake_evidence,Well yes . but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .
4,happiness,fake_evidence,Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !
5,null,null,What other activities will you have tomorrow ?
6,null,null,Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast . and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward . we will make New Year calls on family relatives . husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .
7,null,null,Do you bring some gifts along ?
8,null,null,That's for sure . Fruit . cream cakes . medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives . and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this . of course . should be well prepared beforehand .
9,null,null,Is it the same practice for all families ?
10,null,null,Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families . especially those of newly married couples . choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore . Malaysia . Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .
11,null,null,I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .

3,null,null,Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work . it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
4,disgust,fake_evidence,Oh . yeah . it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus . and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
5,disgust,fake_evidence,That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know . not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
6,null,null,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
7,anger,fake_evidence,You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full . so I waited for the second . and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one . and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
8,null,null,Hmm . Good exercise . uh ?
9,null,null,Yeah . absolutely !
10,null,null,And it ' s so much fun . One day . the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .

3,happiness,fake_evidence,Yeah . I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples . not to mention two people from different cultures .
4,happiness,fake_evidence,Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
5,happiness,fake_evidence,Oh . so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak . then ?

25,null,null,There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .
26,sadness,fake_evidence,Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .
27,null,null,No . don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me . most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .

2,surprise,fake_evidence,What ? What did you buy ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,null,null,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,null,null,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes . Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,null,null,And ?
7,null,null,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,null,null,And it's a brick ?
9,null,null,Yes .
10,null,null,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,null,null,I wanted to . But he said . no . the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened . other people won't believe it's new .
12,null,null,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,null,null,Yes . it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look . it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,null,null,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,null,null,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,null,null,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So . what I think is . you deserve to get cheated !
17,null,null,C'mon . don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,null,null,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19,null,null,You're right . Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

6,null,null,Well . maybe they've got a point . I mean . I suspect that they think the same about us .
7,null,null,Yes . but that doesn't make them right . does it ? Just because they think so ?
8,null,null,I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands . so that innocent people can stop getting killed .
9,null,null,Come on . you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands . otherwise where would we be ?
10,null,null,Well . that's probably true . but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once . so perhaps I have a different view of things .

7,null,null,when's the last time you had it serviced ?

10,null,null,they do . Once my son was born . there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater . you know !
11,null,null,what else is wrong with it ?
12,null,null,the heating controls don't work anymore . so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !
13,null,null,anything else ?
14,null,null,the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
15,null,null,why don't you get it all fixed ?

4,happiness,fake_evidence,Oh . moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .
5,happiness,fake_evidence,Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .

4,null,null,it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
5,null,null,it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus . something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
6,null,null,we could take the subway . but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
7,null,null,train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare . too .
8,null,null,if we don't hurry up . we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
9,null,null,we're already late . so I think we had better take a taxi .
10,null,null,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
11,null,null,fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
12,null,null,it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .

3,happiness,fake_evidence,I think it ' s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .

6,null,null,I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one . but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .
7,null,null,You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed . skill . agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win . but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .

4,null,null,Well sir . our sales have dropped . no plunged . fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory . or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies . it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .

2,null,null,Have you tried university part-time jobs ?
3,null,null,What do you mean ?
4,null,null,I mean in the library . or in some information center . Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .
5,null,null,Yes . I know . I tried that . They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?
6,null,null,Well . since you're a foreign student . it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .
7,sadness,fake_evidence,I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
8,null,null,Anyway . there must be some solution . You know there are many people working illegally in New York .
9,null,null,But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
10,null,null,I have an idea .
11,null,null,What ?
12,null,null,Since you're Chinese . maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .

14,null,null,Well . why don't you go and look down there ?

17,null,null,Maybe . I don't know .
18,null,null,I will ask my friends for you . Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you . You might find something .

11,null,null,Well . I just need to make and receive calls . and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things . the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong . you know ? I mean . this camera function . for instance-how often do you use it ?
12,null,null,Sometimes . but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip . for example . I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .

1,null,null,Hi . Mr . James . what's the rush ?
2,null,null,The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check .
3,null,null,I can lend you some money .
4,happiness,fake_evidence,Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set .

1,null,null,What's wrong ?
2,anger,fake_evidence,I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man . I feel like my head is going to explode .
3,null,null,You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .
4,null,null,The results are too slow . On top of that . just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .
5,null,null,They don't just randomly stick you . they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment . restoring the body's " chi " .
6,fear,fake_evidence,But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?
7,null,null,The needles are very thin . and as long as the doctor's technique is good . and the patient himself is relaxed . it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However . if you are really scared of acupuncture . scraping or cupping are also options .
8,fear,fake_evidence,Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping . your body is all red . as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same . your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .
9,null,null,This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually . there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .
10,null,null,Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill . and then the doctor makes them suffer more .
11,null,null,This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway . if you want to relieve the pain . you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
12,null,null,Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .

1,surprise,fake_evidence,I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
2,null,null,Why not ! It ' s a classic . In fact . it ' s one of my favorite novels .
3,null,null,But it ' s so old .
4,null,null,Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ?
5,null,null,No . not at all .
6,null,null,First of all . it ' s a romance novel . set in the early 19th century .
7,null,null,I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?
8,null,null,It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
9,null,null,Why does he want to do that ?
10,null,null,Since he doesn ' t have a son . he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way . all of his daughters will be cared for .
11,null,null,Won ' t they get his inheritance ?
12,null,null,No . that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off . once he dies . his house will go to his cousin . So . when he dies . the girls will have nothing .
13,happiness,fake_evidence,I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .
14,null,null,So . are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
15,surprise,fake_evidence,There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !
16,null,null,That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
17,null,null,It would take a lot less time ...
18,null,null,How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you .
19,happiness,fake_evidence,Ok . That sounds like a deal .

1,anger,fake_evidence,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?
2,null,null,It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why . I just have a long routine .
3,anger,fake_evidence,Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up . you shower . you get dressed . you brush your teeth . you ' re out the door . Half an hour . tops .
4,anger,fake_evidence,Jacob . you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day . I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day . I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day . I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long . I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards . I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before . but usually I do it in the morning . In all . getting dressed takes about half an hour . at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up . but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then . because of the texture of my hair . I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that . I have my daily makeup routine .
5,null,null,True . I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on . even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me . how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?

1,null,null,Han Maimed . What's your plan for the weekend ?
2,null,null,I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth . I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?
3,null,null,I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .
4,surprise,fake_evidence,Oh . my God ! John . I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook . like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
5,null,null,Come on . Han Maimed . don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans . including many scientists . believe in religion .
6,null,null,But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible . are they ?
7,null,null,Yes . they are compatible . Actually . the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
8,null,null,I've heard about it a little bit before . but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
9,null,null,That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University . which is a highly academic institution . is in a sense the product of religion .
10,surprise,fake_evidence,Really ?
11,null,null,Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
12,null,null,Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
13,null,null,Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
14,surprise,fake_evidence,How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
15,null,null,That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century . there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
16,null,null,So . you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
17,null,null,Yes . that's why Puritans moved to the New World . where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on . it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
18,null,null,Why did they want to found a college ?
19,null,null,Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
20,null,null,Oh . I see .
21,null,null,Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' . without a formal name .
22,null,null,When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
23,null,null,In 1639 . it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly . JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
24,null,null,It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
25,null,null,Therefore . it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion . there would note Harvard .
26,null,null,Wow . I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
27,null,null,Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
28,null,null,I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
29,null,null,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
30,happiness,fake_evidence,That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
31,happiness,fake_evidence,You can ask me any question at any time .
