First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . Oh , OK . Wow ! OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . Wow . That sounds really good .",0,dailydialog_va_410_utt_12_impossible_cause_utt_2

Thanks for inviting me . My pleasure . I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market .

Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .

I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . The Taj it is then . Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? They'll still charge us a corkage fee . That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway .

We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery !

Let's go ! <SEP> Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . The Taj it is then . Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? They'll still charge us a corkage fee . That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . I won't argue with that !

And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! That ' s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . What does that mean ?

I need a volunteer . Me ! Me ! Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . Wait , what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this ! Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . Well , OK . But no French kissing ! As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . Wait , what are you doing !

The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen .

Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work . If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money . I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !",0,dailydialog_va_428_utt_16_impossible_cause_utt_3

It went straight through the wickets . <SEP> I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . I certainly can try ... No !

The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .

Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .

I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",0,dailydialog_va_184_utt_13_impossible_cause_utt_1
