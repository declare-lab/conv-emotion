3,anger,fake_evidence,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
4,null,null,I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
5,null,null,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
6,null,null,Well . now we're stuck . What can we do ?
7,null,null,I don't know .
8,null,null,I've heard that when this happens . it's important to save energy .
9,null,null,What do you mean ?
10,null,null,We're stranded here . Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
11,null,null,I have plenty of gas .
12,null,null,Yes . but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do . it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13,null,null,So what can we do ?
14,null,null,Turn the lights off . Then . run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,Alright . That's a good idea .
16,null,null,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
17,null,null,Days ?

4,null,null,if he didn't have any drug problems . he would have won .
5,surprise,fake_evidence,what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6,null,null,he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7,null,null,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8,null,null,they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9,null,null,that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,null,null,I don't think it's right . but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11,null,null,regardless of how much pressure you're under . there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12,null,null,I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations . fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
