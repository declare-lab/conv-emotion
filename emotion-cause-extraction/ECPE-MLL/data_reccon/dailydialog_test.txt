1,anger,fake_evidence,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .
2,null,null,Let me check . sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night .
3,anger,fake_evidence,That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .
4,null,null,Okay . sir . bear with me a moment .
5,null,null,Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
6,null,null,One slight problem . sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .

1,anger,fake_evidence,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
2,null,null,cool down . Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?
3,anger,fake_evidence,yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot . without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .
4,null,null,is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price . and the buyer tries his best to bring it down . until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .
5,anger,fake_evidence,but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
6,null,null,of course . that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .

5,happiness,fake_evidence,Yes . and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .
6,sadness,fake_evidence,It ' s a pity we can ' t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .

14,null,null,This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
15,happiness,fake_evidence,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
16,happiness,fake_evidence,Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .

4,null,null,It is not only the earthquake . sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
5,surprise,fake_evidence,Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
6,null,null,That's what we thought . sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .
7,sadness,fake_evidence,Oh . that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But . if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries . it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !
8,sadness,fake_evidence,I'm sorry . sir .
9,null,null,It's not your fault . Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?
10,null,null,Well . it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight . I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .
11,null,null,Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
12,null,null,But sir ...
13,null,null,Yes . Yuri ?
14,null,null,I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .
15,null,null,Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
16,null,null,No . sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting . sir .
17,null,null,Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
18,null,null,You know the government controls the press here . sir . They don't want it reported .
19,sadness,fake_evidence,Oh . this is terrible . Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud . or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No . I can't believe this mess !
20,sadness,fake_evidence,I'm sorry . sir .
21,sadness,fake_evidence,You don't have to keep saying that . Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh . what can we do ?

5,happiness,fake_evidence,No . I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon . but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual . yet sophisticated .
6,null,null,I like the jeans . but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .
7,null,null,How about this scarf . these earrings . and an anklet ?
8,null,null,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9,happiness,fake_evidence,That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10,happiness,fake_evidence,Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there . and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11,null,null,Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12,happiness,fake_evidence,That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13,happiness,fake_evidence,The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK . I'll take it .

5,happiness,fake_evidence,Tiger Woods is about to tee off . and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and . he seems to be very nervous .
6,sadness,fake_evidence,Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
7,sadness,fake_evidence,It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .
8,fear,fake_evidence,Oh no ! A bear ! Run . Tiger . run ! Somebody call animal control !

8,null,null,Was there anyone else with you ?
9,null,null,Of course . there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .
10,null,null,So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
11,null,null,Yes . I have to call the property management .
12,null,null,For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?
13,null,null,Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about . and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .
14,null,null,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
15,null,null,I know what you mean . but I'd better remind them again . and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .

5,null,null,No . it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .
6,null,null,That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
7,null,null,Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .

10,null,null,Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes . which is called cologne .
11,surprise,fake_evidence,Oh . really . that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
12,null,null,It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .

15,null,null,How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .

9,disgust,fake_evidence,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,disgust,fake_evidence,I don't think it's right . but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !

5,happiness,fake_evidence,OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
6,null,null,First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl . and whisk them up . quite . so they're quite high and fluffy . and in a hot pan . and you need a pan that's that's kind of small . that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up . so it's quite hot . and then you take your whipped up eggs . or whisked up eggs . and pour them into the pan . and as it's cooking . if you take a spatula . and push the bottom layer of the egg . to the side . to the sides . and then to the middle . so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .
7,happiness,fake_evidence,Oh . OK . Wow !
8,null,null,OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over . you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
9,happiness,fake_evidence,Wow . That sounds really good .

3,happiness,fake_evidence,Yes . it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
4,happiness,fake_evidence,I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card . but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors . own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

10,null,null,Actually . I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically . it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .
